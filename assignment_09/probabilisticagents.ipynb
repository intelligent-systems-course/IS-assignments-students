    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "At the end of this exercise you should be able to work with some basic fuzzy concepts, and implement and evaluate a simple probabilistic approach to playing Schnapsen. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "In this worksheet we will implement a simple probabilistic strategy for an agent to play Schnapsen. \n",

    "Follow this Notebook step-by-step. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you can do the exercises in any Programming Editor of your liking. But you do not have to. Feel free to simply write code in the Notebook. Please use your studentID+Assignment9.ipynb as the name of the Notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: unlike the courses dedicated to programming we will not evaluate the style of the programs. But we will, however, test your programs on other data that we provide, and your program should give the correct output to the test-data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "As was mentioned, the assignment is graded as pass/fail. To pass you need to have either a full working code or an explanation of what you tried and what didn't work for the tasks that you were unable to complete (you can use multi-line comments or a text cell).\n",

    "## Initialising\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we have to install the schnapsen python package. \n",
    "Run the below code cell.\n",
    "After running the cell, you have the schnapsen Github repository cloned in your current directory.\n",
    "You can find the new directory created with the name `schnapsen`.\n",
    "The detailed installation instructions can be found in the [README.md](https://github.com/intelligent-systems-course/schnapsen) of the repo.\n"

    "Unless we are very much mistaken, your new probability bot will not perform very well. One reason for this is that our probabilistic strategy has a serious flaw: the Aces and 10s have a high probability of not having a higher card of the same suit, so that our strategy will pick valuable cards in phase 1. This is a high-gain, but also a high-cost strategy, as a reasonably good opponent would trump those cards and win valuable points. \n",
    "\n",
    "One possible solution is to combine the probability of a card being easily beaten with the costs it takes to loose such a card. We do this by introducing a notion of utily, which simply divides the probability of being good by the costs of a potential loss of the played card. \n",
