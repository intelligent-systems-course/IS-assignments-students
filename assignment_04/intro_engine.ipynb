    "At the end of this exercise you should be able to use the Schnapsen platform, run basic games between agents, and run tournaments in order to evaluate rational agents (also called bots).\n",

    "Note: unlike the courses dedicated to programming we will not evaluate the style of the programs. But we will, however, test your programs on other data that we provide, and your program should give the correct output to the test-data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "As was mentioned, the assignment is graded as pass/fail. To pass you need to have either a full working code or an explanation of what you tried and what didn't work for the tasks that you were unable to complete (you can use multi-line comments or a text cell).\n",

    "First, we have to install the schnapsen python package. \n",
