    "\n",
    "At the end of this exercise you should be able to work with some basic Machine Learning concepts, and implement and evaluate simple classifiers for *spam classification* using the popular machine learning library scikit-learn(https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).\n",
    "Scikit-learn offers a many helpful methods for creating simple machine learning models and to perform data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will:\n",
    "1. Use pandas to read a dataset from a comma-separated-value (.csv) file.\n",
    "2. You should be able to create tf-idf feature vectors with scikit-learn.\n",
    "3. You should be able to create a simple classification and evaluate basic classification models.\n",
    "4. You should have learned to improve classification models for textual data.\n",

    "Follow this Notebook step-by-step. For this course it is necessary that you manipulate the python programmes we provide. You can do the exercises in any Programming Editor of your liking. Still, please fill in the questions in this notebook as usual. \n",

    "Please use your studentID+Assignment10.ipynb as the name of the Notebook, and fill in the missing cells.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: unlike the courses dedicated to programming we will not evaluate the style of the programs. But we will, however, test your programs on other data that we provide, and your program should give the correct output to the test-data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "As was mentioned, the assignment is graded as pass/fail. To pass you need to have either a full working code or an explanation of what you tried and what didn't work for the tasks that you were unable to complete (you can use multi-line comments or a text cell).\n"
